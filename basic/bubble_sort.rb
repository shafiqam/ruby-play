Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array.
It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless,
wouldnâ€™t it?).

    # one less since the largest is swapped all the way to the end
    # other one less since we look at two elements at once, to avoid out of bound index
    for j in (0..(n-1)-i-1)
